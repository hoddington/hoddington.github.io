# Microsoft 365 Copilot | How it works

## Large Language Models
Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a class of artificial intelligence models that specialize in understanding and generating human-like text. The "large" in LLM signifies both the size of the models in terms of the number of parameters they encompass, and the vast volume of data on which they're trained.

LLMs, including models like ChatGPT, are a type of generative AI. These are models that can create new content based on patterns learned from their training data. Instead of merely predicting or classifying, generative AI, like LLMs, can produce entirely new content. When applied to text, LLMs can generate contextually relevant and syntactically correct responses based on the provided prompts.

In the context of Microsoft 365 Copilot, LLMs are the engine that drives Copilot's capabilities. Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service privately hosts these models, which Copilot uses to understand user inputs and generate relevant responses.

Through the careful application of these models, Copilot helps you navigate your work more effectively, while ensuring privacy and data integrity.

## Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a pivotal AI technology that helps machines understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a way that's meaningful. In essence, NLP is the technology behind Copilot's ability to read, comprehend, and generate text similar to how humans would. Some of the components involved are:  
* **Tokenization**: Simplifies complex paragraphs by breaking down text into smaller chunks, like words or phases  
* **Semantic Analysis**: Helps Copilot understand the underlying meaning or context  
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Assess the mood or emotion behind a text, Copilot can understand user intent more accurately.   
* **Language Translation**: Aids in multilingual tasks, allowing Copilot to assist users across different languages.  

For Copilot, NLP is integral as it bridges the gap between human language and machine understanding. It's this tech that ensures when you ask Copilot something, it understands and responds effectively.

## Semantic Index for Copilot
The Semantic Index for Copilot constructs an intricate map of your personal and company data, establishing important connections and identifying significant relationships, much like the inner workings of the human brain. It goes beyond the confines of keyword search by interpreting and encoding the conceptual relationships between data elements. By analyzing your Microsoft Graph data - encompassing emails, documents, calendars, chats, and more - and working synergistically with LLMs, it delivers personalized, relevant, and actionable responses. Explore the video below to comprehend how the Semantic Index prepares Microsoft 365 Copilot, and your organization, to be AI-ready."

## Microsoft Graph
Microsoft Graph is essentially the connective tissue that binds all your Microsoft 365 services and data together. It's a unified API endpoint that provides access to data and intelligence within Microsoft 365. This includes data from services like Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams, and more.

Copilot applies Microsoft Graph and the Semantic Index to synthesize and search content from multiple sources within your tenant. This means you don't need to navigate away or switch apps - Copilot brings the relevant information to you.

Copilot takes user permissions, data security, and compliance seriously. It only generates responses based on the information you're allowed to access. It achieves this through Microsoft Graph, a robust framework for secure data access. So you can rest assured, Copilot's powerful capabilities always align with your company's security and privacy policies.

Microsoft Graph does more than just simplify data accessibility. It empowers Copilot to deliver contextually aware and secure assistance right in your digital workspace. It's all about enhancing your productivity while keeping your data secure.

## Microsoft 365 apps
Apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and Loop operate with Copilot to support users in the context of their work. For example, Copilot in Word specifically assists users in the process of creating, comprehending, and editing documents. In a similar way, Copilot in the other apps helps users in the context of their work within those apps.

## Microsoft 365 Chat
Chat enables Copilot users to make use of cross-app intelligence. The conversational Chat interface allows Copilot to understand user intent and provide ongoing dialogue. The chat format enhances the context. This feature provides users with a simpler way to work with multiple apps. Users access cross-app intelligence by chat in the same way they would interact using open prompts with ChatGPT or Bing chat. Those prompts access not only the core training data in the Large Language Model (LLM), but also the users’ business data and apps. By doing so, Chat surfaces the information and insights that users need from their organization’s data. Prompts work with Copilot across a range of experiences, including Teams (chat), Bing, Microsoft Edge, and the Microsoft 365 app.
